# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the

# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or

# Mutex: Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory
# for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults
#
# Using pthread here, since Apache tries to chown the file-based mutex
# which isn't allowed in Snappy, and Ubuntu supports robust pthread
# mutexes that can be recovered if the child process terminates
# abnormally.

# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you

# Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.

# Example:
# LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so
