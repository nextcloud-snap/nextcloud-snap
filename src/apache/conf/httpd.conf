# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or

# Mutex: Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory
# for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults
#
# Using pthread here, since Apache tries to chown the file-based mutex
# which isn't allowed in Snappy, and Ubuntu supports robust pthread
# mutexes that can be recovered if the child process terminates
# abnormally.

# to be loaded here.

# Example:
# LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so

# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'

#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
