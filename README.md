# Nextcloud in a snap
The Nextcloud snap is designed to offer a fully production-ready instance of Nextcloud with minimal setup and maintenance (it updates automatically). If you aren't a web developer and don't need to tweak Nextcloud like one, the snap will probably work perfectly for you.

Specifically, the snap consists of:

- Nextcloud 25
- Apache 2.4
- PHP 8.0
- MySQL 8
- Redis 6
- mDNS for network discovery
